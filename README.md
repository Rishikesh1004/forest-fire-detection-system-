# üå≤üî• Forest Fire Detection System

A computer vision-based forest fire detection system built using a custom dataset and the YOLOv8 object detection model. This project allows users to detect fires in forest images and videos in real-time through a user-friendly Streamlit web interface.

## üöÄ Features

- üî• Detects forest fires in images and videos
- üì¶ Built with YOLOv8 for high-speed, accurate inference
- üñºÔ∏è Streamlit app for simple drag-and-drop file upload
- üß† Trained on a custom forest fire dataset
- üí° Real-time visualization of detection results

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- PIL (Pillow)

## ‚úÖ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishikesh1004/forest-fire-detection-system-.git
cd forest-fire-detection-system-
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Ensure you have Python 3.7 or above and `ultralytics` installed.

### 3. Download the YOLOv8 Model

Place your trained YOLOv8 model (`best.pt`) inside the project directory.

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üìÅ Input Types

- Image: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`
- Video: `mp4`, `avi`, `mov`, `mkv`

## üìå Usage

1. Choose between **Image** or **Video** upload in the dropdown.
2. Upload your file.
3. View detection results with fire areas highlighted.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Integrate live drone camera feeds
